# Hey, I'm Sam Kelley! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here’s a bit about me and what I’m passionate about in tech, life, and beyond.

## 👀 About Me
I'm Sam, also known here as **@sammysprinkler**. Currently, I work as an **Assistant VP and Information Technology Infrastructure Engineer at Wells Fargo**, where I specialize in designing and implementing robust cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity solutions. With a BS in Information Technology from the **University of South Carolina**, I bring both technical expertise and a strategic perspective to my work.

I have hands-on experience with:
- **Cloud Infrastructure** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, and **Microsoft Azure**
- **Containerization** and **Orchestration** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
- **Cybersecurity frameworks** that protect data and mitigate risk

In my role, I'm part of an Agile Kanban team, where I enjoy collaborating on high-level technical projects, designing and debugging complex systems, and supporting end-to-end automation solutions. My goal? To deliver innovative, secure, and high-performing technology solutions that empower the enterprise.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
Beyond my core responsibilities, I'm passionate about:
- **Hacking and Cybersecurity** — diving into vulnerabilities and ethical hacking techniques
- **Flipper Zero scripting** and automation for fun and practical applications
- **Life hacks** and **tech experiments** that simplify or enhance everyday tasks

As a lifelong learner, I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to experiment with.

## 🌎 Fun Facts
Outside of tech, I'm an avid traveler who has explored **over 45 countries**, gaining diverse perspectives and experiences along the way. I also played **college football**, which built my resilience and love for teamwork. When I’m not working or hacking, you can usually find me:
- Working out 🏋️
- Hiking with my husky, Copper 🐺
- Planning my next adventure ✈️

## 💼 Looking to Collaborate
I’m open to collaborating on projects related to:
- Cybersecurity and ethical hacking
- Infrastructure automation and cloud solutions
